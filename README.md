# Clarity — GitHub Pages (i18n + Auto-Redirect + Social Meta)

## Deploy
- Upload these files to a public GitHub repo.
- Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch (main /docs).
- Replace DOMAIN in meta tags with your real domain or GitHub Pages URL.

## Auto-Redirect
- The root page (/index.html) redirects users based on browser language (ar/ru/zh).
- Add `?noredirect=1` to bypass during testing.

## Full-Res Assets
- Upload PNG/PDF/ZIP into `docs/assets/full/` with the expected filenames.
- Thumbnails are in `docs/assets/web/`.
