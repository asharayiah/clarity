    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      This page is a transparent, public outreach to the scientific and funding communities in the USA, Russia, China, and beyond.
      The aim is to unite global efforts for humanityâ€™s benefit â€” not under politics, not for personal gain, and not to serve any single nation or agenda.
      All research outcomes will be made available here on the Clarity platform for anyone to inspect, use, or build upon ethically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already completed the research independently and will present the outcomes directly.  
      This includes root-level approaches to solve urgent global challenges â€” from cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and mental illnesses (autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, PTSD) to universal frameworks for ethics in the age of AI.
    </p>
    <p><strong>No personal gain is sought</strong> â€” only a coordinated, principled, and global approach.</p>

    <h2>For Scientists</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a scientist â€” in physics, biology, AI, medicine, or other fields â€” this is your invitation to collaborate on the basis of truth-seeking beyond institutional or national limits.
      I welcome critique, debate, and rigorous inspection of every proof-of-concept published here.

    <h2>For Funders</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a funder or philanthropist, know that this is not a request for money.  
      Instead, it is a chance to help scale the ethical application of solutions that already exist, without the waste of exploratory guesswork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your role is to help safeguard and deploy these solutions globally â€” prioritizing life, dignity, and justice.

    <h2>For Hybrid Influencers</h2>
    <p>
      Some people bridge science, policy, and philanthropy. If you are among them, this invitation is for you to serve as a cross-domain catalyst â€” breaking silos and building unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Clarity platform will always remain open for public review, removing any room for hidden agendas.
